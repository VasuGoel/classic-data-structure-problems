We have to divide vector into 2 parts/subsets so that absolute difference of sum of elements in these 2 partitions is minimum. An ideal case, would be if vector could be divided into 2 subsets with equal sum (partition problem)
in that case, absolute difference between sum of those 2 subsets would be 0. 
We can leverage that idea to find the minimum sum closest to (sum of elements in vector) / 2, in which vector can be partitioned and it would guarantee absolute difference between sum of those subsets would be min.

Consider elements [10, 20, 15, 5, 25], with total = 75. Here, min sum partition would be 5 when vector is partitioned as [10, 20, 5], [15, 25] (or [10, 25], [20, 15, 5])
We can set k = 75/2 = 37 and use DP to find subset sum

From the DP table, it it clear that 35 is closest to 37 in which vector can be partitoned. Hence, min sum = |(total - 35) - 35|= 5, where 35 is sum of one partition and (total - 35) is sum of the other partition
